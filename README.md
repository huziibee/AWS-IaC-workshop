# AWS CloudFormation and CDK Workshop

This repository contains a series of workflows to help you get started with AWS CloudFormation and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) using Python. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you'll learn how to automate the creation of AWS resources using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with sufficient permissions for resource deployment.
- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
- Python (version 3.9 or higher is recommended).
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with a terminal session.
- [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) installed.

## Getting Started with CloudFormation

### Creating an S3 Bucket with CloudFormation

To create an S3 bucket using CloudFormation, execute the following command in your VSCode terminal:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name S3Stack-condition --template-body file://s3-cloudformation-condition.yaml
```

### Challenge: Create a Production Bucket

Your task is to create a new S3 bucket for the production environment using the same CloudFormation template. Follow these steps:

1. Use the command from the previous section.
2. Use a new stack name.
3. Utilize the `parameters.json` file to pass parameters without editing the template.

### Conclusion of Workflow

In this workflow, you learned how to use conditions in your CloudFormation template to efficiently re-use code across multiple environments. Conditions help in developing environment-specific configurations, managing resources, and outputs more effectively.

## Introduction to AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

### Installing the AWS CDK

To install the AWS CDK, run the following command in your VSCode terminal:

```bash
sudo npm install -g aws-cdk
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
cdk --version
```

Ensure you are running version 2.150.0 or higher.

### Creating Your First CDK Project

1. Create a new project directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-first-cdk-project
   cd my-first-cdk-project
   ```

2. Initialize a new CDK project using Python:

   ```bash
   cdk init app --language python
   ```

   This will create the necessary files and directory structure for your CDK project.

3. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Creating an S3 Bucket using CDK

Edit the `my_first_cdk_project_stack.py` file to define an S3 bucket:

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    Stack,
    aws_s3 as s3
)
from constructs import Construct

class MyFirstCdkProjectStack(Stack):

    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        s3.Bucket(
            self, 
            id="bucket123", 
            bucket_name="<your-unique-bucket-name>",  # Use a globally unique bucket name
            versioned=True,
            encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED
        )
```

### Deploying the CDK Stack

1. List the stacks:

   ```bash
   cdk ls
   ```

2. Synthesize the CloudFormation template:

   ```bash
   cdk synth
   ```

3. Bootstrap your environment:

   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

4. Deploy the stack:

   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

### Conclusion of Workflow

In this workflow, you learned how to use the AWS CDK to define and deploy AWS resources using Python. You practiced commands like `cdk synth`, `cdk bootstrap`, and `cdk deploy`.

## Cleanup

To avoid incurring unnecessary costs, clean up your AWS resources after completing the workflows:

1. Delete any objects you added to the S3 bucket.
2. Delete the CloudFormation stacks.

These actions can be performed through the AWS Management Console.

## Summary

Congratulations on completing the AWS CloudFormation and CDK workflows! You have gained hands-on experience with Infrastructure-as-Code tools and should feel more confident in using these techniques to manage and deploy your AWS resources.
